# DSMPrompt - A new way to DSM

## What is it?
- DSMPrompt is an all in one solution for DSMing a show. 
- Convert pdf scripts easily to our format
- Export scripts
- Create, update, read and delete color-coded cues for LX, SFX and STAGE.
- Run shows live.
- Use an open source 3d ESP based project to integrate line-syncing across devices.
- And more!

## Line syncing?
- Yep! By connecting to a MQTT server running on a WiFi network, experiece line by line sync between the DSM and anybody else! Cues are synced also - so everynody is on the same page. No longer are the days where you need to ask the DSM where the show currently is!
