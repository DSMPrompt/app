# DSMPrompt - A new way to DSM

## What is it?
- DSMPrompt is an all in one solution for DSMing a show. 
- Convert pdf scripts easily to our format
- Export scripts
- Create, update, read and delete color-coded cues for LX, SFX and STAGE.
- Run shows live.
- Use an open source 3d ESP based project to integrate line-syncing across devices.
- Everything's local, so no worries about internet loss
- And more!

## Planned Major Features
- Multi-user shows with informative views for Lighting, Sound, Props, Stage Crew (on Apple Watch)
- Automatic on-the-fly cue updates on the aforementioned devices
- Preshow checks from each user, ensuring everyone's ready, even off the comms link!
