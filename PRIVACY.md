# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 3 October 2025  
**Last Updated:** 3 October 2025

## Overview

DSMPrompt (“the App”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our approach to data collection and usage.

## Data Collection

**We collect no data. Period.**

DSMPrompt is designed as a completely local application. All information you create, store, or manage within the App remains exclusively on your device.

## What This Means

- **No Personal Information:** We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal information
- **No Usage Analytics:** We do not track how you use the App
- **No Third-Party Services:** We do not integrate any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services
- **No Account Required:** The App functions entirely offline with no account creation or login
- **No Cloud Sync:** Your scripts, cues, timings, and notes stay on your device unless you explicitly export them

## Your Data

All content created in DSMPrompt—including scripts, line markings, cue calls, timing data, and notes—is stored locally on your device using iOS standard storage mechanisms. You maintain complete control over this data.

## Data Export

When you choose to export scripts or performance reports as PDFs, these files are generated locally on your device. Any sharing of these files is handled through iOS’s native sharing mechanisms and is entirely under your control.

## Children’s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the App and on our website.
